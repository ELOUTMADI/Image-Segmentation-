# Medical Image-Segmentation
The term image segmentation refers to "the partitioning of an image into a set of areas that span it. The goal of segmentation is to simplify and transform the representation of an image so that it is clearer and easier to analyze ". In medical imaging, these segments often correspond to different categories of tissues, organs, pathologies, or other biologically relevant structures . Atlas segmentation is a medical imaging technique for subdividing images. Training images are manually labeled by a clinical expert to segment unpublished images from these training images. Image registration is a process that seeks to correct the alignment of images "to standardize the image or images in the atlas to a new unpublished image" .
