# Image-Segmentation
We discuss the method of segmentation by the transfer of points of interest, where the organs are defined by the transfer of labeling planes, at the origin of an image bank forming part of the training, towards the new image to segment. The transfer is based on scattered image matches between points of interest that represent distinctive and automatically marked image areas. The segmentation algorithm consists of three steps: (i) matching points of interest; (ii) marking of detected points of interest; (iii) and the probabilistic transfer, established on the points of interest, of the organ marking schemes. The accuracy of the method compares with satisfaction to the current multi-atlas segmentation while offering a speed of about three orders of magnitude. In addition, the transfer of points of interest does not require any learning period or registration in an atlas. The robustness of the algorithm allows the segmentation of images taken with highly variable fields of view.
